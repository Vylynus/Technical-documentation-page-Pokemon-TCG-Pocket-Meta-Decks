    <p>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket (often abbreviated as Pokémon TCG Pocket) is a free-to-play mobile adaptation of the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), developed by Creatures Inc. and DeNA, and published by The Pokémon Company. The game was revealed on February 27, 2024 during a Pokémon Presents presentation and officially released on October 30, 2024, on both iOS and Android devices. Pokémon TCG Pocket serves as a mobile adaptation of the traditional TCG, allowing players to collect cards, build decks, and engage in battles against other players. The game incorporates features designed for mobile gameplay, including daily rewards and animated cards, while maintaining the core mechanics of the original TCG</p>
        <p>As of December 12, 2024, Pokémon TCG Pocket surpassed 60 million downloads. The game was nominated for "Best Mobile Game" at The Game Awards 2024. It has generated approximately $3 million per day in revenue since its release. Japan accounted for 45 percent of total earnings after four days of release, while the United States followed as the second biggest market, contributing 25 percent of the app store revenue for the game. Total revenues reached $120.8 million less than a month after launch.</p>

         <p>All the Pokemon TCG Pocket best decks are ranked in the tier list below, where you can see where they place in the current meta. The Space-Time Smackdown expansion has completely opened up the options, with new powerful Dark and Metal type decks. PTCGP is still very much in flux following the new cards, with headliners Palkia and Dialga, as well as Weavile, Darkrai, and more besides.</p>
        <p>If you want to know what you can get out of them, below we've got all of the details and what you need to know about crafting all the best decks in PTCGP, where they rank from S-tier down, and what cards you'll need to construct them.</p>

            <p>The Mythical Island booster for Pokemon TCG added Celebi ex, a powerful grass-type who established this meta-busting deck.</p>
        <p>This Celebi ex deck prioritizes the mythical psychic and grass Pokemon with a fearsome ability to land exponential damage. On a baseline level, Celebi’s attack is worth 50 hit points. But for every energy attached to it, Celebi gets a coin toss. Every head you land adds an additional 50 points of damage. Most Pokemon have less than 80 HP, which means that lucky players can kill an ex Pokemon in one go.</p>
        <p>To maximize Celebi’s effectiveness, you’ll want to pair it with Serperior, another new card. Serperior’s Jungle Totem ability makes every grass-type energy count as two, which means that a Celebi with a mere 2-3 energy will get many chances at a favorable coin toss. Serperior is a third stage evolution, however, meaning it will take some setting up before you can unleash its fury. Fortunately, Dhelmise makes great usage of Serperior’s energy boosting with a 20 HP ability that can add 70 additional HP when the card accrues at least 3 energy.</p>

            <li>Pros</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Potential for huge damage output</li>
                <li>Multiple attack options</li>
                <li>plenty of grass-type alternate card options, such as Exeggutor and Lilligant</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cons</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Takes a lot of setup</li>
                <li>Acquiring Celebi, a rare card, is difficult</li>
                <li>can be countered with easier to obtain fire decks</li>

         <p>Venusaur ex and grass decks are the only options in Pokemon TCG Pocket for healing and recovery on a major level.</p>
        <p>You can shuffle around the exact numbers of items to taste, but ultimately the goal here is to get Lilligant active on the field so it can then provide energy to the Bulbasaur on the bench. You play defensively, healing and controlling, all the while evolving Bulbasaur to the Venusaur ex. Once you're done, swap them around and bring in the big grass frog.</p>
        <p>Venusaur ex's Giant Bloom does 100 damage while healing it for 30 every turn - not to mention the fact that it's pretty tanky at 190 HP. Unless your opponent is running a Charizard deck as shown above, it should be impossible to one-shot your team mascot. If you want some alternate variants for the deck, try bringing in Exeggutor ex early on, or having Caterpie to more quickly draw Pokemon cards.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pros</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Venusaur is a sturdy tank</li>
                <li>Erika is a powerful healing card</li>
                <li>Liligant is a good energy provider</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cons</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Lacks major firepower</li>
                <li>Dependent on good draws</li>
                <li>Fire decks are common right now</li>
            </ul>

      </header>  
        <p>The new Pokemon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown expansion has added a bunch of strong new cards and opened up this Dark-type deck based around Weavile ex and Darkrai ex.</p>
        <p>This is a high-power deck based around unrelenting offensive power from the off, as well as some energy control to keep Darkrai ex's ability going. Meanwhile, a supporting hand of control cards like Cyrus and Pokemon Communication mean that you can keep that offense maintained, dragging damaged Pokemon back into play or even damaging benched Pokemon directly with Spiritomb.</p>
        <p>The downside here is a lack of any real killer attacks - a big tanky Blastoise will survive anything you have for at least a while, so you need to ensure it never reaches the late-game phase. If something can survive your barrage, like Mewtwo ex, nothing you have is durable enough to stand up to a long assault. Still, a powerful early game has been a staple of the meta from the beginning, and Weavile ex being so potent off the bat (not to mention Dawn's energy control) means you can really come out swinging here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pros</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Very strong early game</li>
                <li>Strong against the relatively common psychic decks</li>
                <li>Good board control</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cons</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Weak to grass decks</li>
                <li>No real  late-gaame powerhouse attacks</li>
                <li>Lower health pools</li>
            </ul>
